I had a bit of trouble getting used to LESS, but it started to make sense the further I got into the project. I couldn't figure out how to add an opacity to the hero image, so I edited it in photoshop. Overall, LESS is pretty easy to use, it'll just take some getting used to. 

I used the bootstrap site to help me remember how to use bootstrap.
